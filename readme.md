##### **How Browser and Server Communicate with Each Other?**

HTTP stands for HyperText Transport Protocol. HTTP is used for communication between the client and server. Let us understand what it means by client and server with an example.

Suppose, you open the web browser, type the *URL* in the browser and press the enter button. As soon as you press enter, a request is going to the server (called a web server). Whatever data you are sending from the web browser to the web server is called a Request and whatever data you are receiving from the web server is called a Response. This is how the browser and web server communicate with each other in the form of Requests and Responses. And this type of communication is only possible by using HTTP Protocol. So, the request can be termed an HTTP Request and the response can be called HTTP Response. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following image.
